# algo academy - week 1 - day 1 - intro to ds&a

## data structures and algorithms

### what are data structures and algorithms

- data structure: simply a way to STORE data
  - examples:
    - arrays
    - hash tables
    - hash sets
    - linked lists
    - trees
    - graphs
- algorithms: ways to INTERACT with our data
  - goal is to create, read, edit, or delete data in a way that is useful
- we will look at this in context of coding interviews
  - design
  - implementation
  - tradeoffs

### why?

- helps us understand how efficient our solutions are in a measurable way
- use of good ds&a practices make your code more SCALABLE
- most importantly: IT'S ON THE INTERVIEW

### best way to study?

- blind75
  - leetcode discussion
  - created by someone who did hundreds of leetcode problems and found
    - 75 to be the most useful for him for reviewing fundamentals
  - some problems very difficult for someone just starting though
- neetcode
  - started by unemployed aspiring software developer
  - slowly practiced over the course of a year and was able to get into Google
  - ordered things in a way that made sense (similar to Structy)

### 3 different ways to study

1. targeted study

- choose a specific topic(s) and study problems from those topics

  > pros: allows you to repeat similar problems together to more easily see patterns
  > that would indicate when to use a particular strategy

  > cons: you already have a notion of what kind of strategy to use,
  > which isnt accurate to how a real-life interview works

2. random study

- choose randomly selected problems to solve

  > pros: forces you to read the prompt more carefully and practice noticing
  > keywords and patterns in order to recognize what kind of strategy to use

  > cons: many find it difficult to see patterns for a particular topic when constantly
  > switching around, especially when first starting out

3. mock interviews

- solve a random problem under a time constraint
- in front of someone who asks you follow up questions

  > pros: forces you to practice communicating your thoughts and manage your time,
  > which are additional skills needed to succeed in an interview

  > cons: can be time consuming and not time efficient when it comes to learning material

### where to start

- arrays
- hashing
- linked lists
- recursion
- sorting algorithms
- binary search
- trees
- heaps
- tries
- graphs
- dynamic programming
  > order matters, builds on itself

### is it enough to solve the problem

- NO
  - we must analyze and understand our solutions
  - we must ensure we can confidently communicate our ideas
  - track progres, memorize concepts and ideas, not solutions

### track progress

- notion calendar

### how to get most out of workshop

- document progress: spend last 5-10 min of pairboarding sessions writing a few short notes about problem
  - reflect on every problem you do, regardless of how easy or hard
  - mark down problems you struggled with, return to them after a week so that it isnt fresh on your mind
