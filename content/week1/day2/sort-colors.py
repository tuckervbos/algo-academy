# sort-colors

# Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, 
# sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, 
# with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

# We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, 
# and blue, respectively.

# You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
# Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [2,0,1]
# Output: [0,1,2]
 
# Constraints:
# n == nums.length
# 1 <= n <= 300
# nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.
 
# Follow up: Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

# approach: 
# if limited to a few options, usually a good indicator for using bucket-sort

# for n in range(len(counts))     Loop over indexes 0, 1, 2             Know which number weâ€™re rewriting (0s, 1s, 2s)
# for c in range(counts[n])       Loop for each occurrence of number n  Write that number the correct number of times
